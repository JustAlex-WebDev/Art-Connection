# E-Commerce-Shop-FAKE-API-Project

## About the project

An E-Commerce Shop, which will originally be created using local data, simple html, css and javascript. And then it will
be transformed into more advanced project with the help of REACT and JSON server. 
The two ways in which the project will be done will seperated into different branches and the main branch will 
contain the second more advanced way in which the project will be build.

### Expected updates to the project (very soon)

I will transform all the code into REACT, by using components, styled components, hooks as useEffect and useState. 
Also i will make a JSON server from which i would fetch my data.

### Why I am building the project

This project will be build in order to train responsive HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
Also, it will be a great way for me to learn some more advanced ways of web development.
