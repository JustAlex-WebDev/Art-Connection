### **Challenge**

The client presented an existing software in production and aimed to revolutionize its functionality and overall appearance. Developed by the client's team from 2016 to 2019, the software accumulated valuable business data, including 2,000 customer records by August 2019. A decision was made to rewrite the codebase from scratch to accommodate new features, focusing on universality and scalability to support Art Connection's anticipated growth.

### **Process**

- Provided ongoing support and maintenance throughout the development process.

**Testing and Feedback**
- Collected and implemented feedback from end-users during testing phases.

**Implementation Support**
- Assisted and supported the application’s implementation.

### **Technologies Used**
- **React** for development
- **Firebase** for hosting and a reliable database
- **Stripe** for seamless payment integration
- **TypeScript** for type safety and cleaner code

### **Outcome**

The new Art Connection application, although still in production, offers:
