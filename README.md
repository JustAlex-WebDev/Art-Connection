# E-Commerce-Shop-FAKE-API-Project

## About the project

An E-Commerce Shop, which will originally be created using local data, simple html, css and javascript. And then it will
be transformed into more advanced project with the help of REACT and JSON server.
The two ways in which the app will be done will be seperated into different branches and the main branch will
contain the second (more advanced) way in which the project will be build.

## Why I am building the project

This project will be build in order to train responsive HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Fake APIs.
By putting my skills into practise, it will be a great way for me to learn some more advanced ways of web development.
