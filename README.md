# E-Commerce-Shop-REST-API-Project

## About the project

This project will be build in order to train responsive HTML, CSS and Javascript.
An E-Commerce Shop which originally will be created with local data and then it will
be made to work with REST API using fetch() and REACT.

## Expected updates to the project

I will transform all the code into REACT, by using components, styled components, hooks as useEffect and useState.
Also i will make a JSON server from which i would fetch my data.
