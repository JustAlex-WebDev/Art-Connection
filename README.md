# E-Commerce-Shop-FAKE-API-Project

## About the project

This project will be build in order to train responsive HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
Also, it will be a great way for me to learn some more advanced ways of development. 
An E-Commerce Shop, which will originally be created using local data and then it will
be transformed into REACT.

## Expected updates to the project (very soon)

I will transform all the code into REACT, by using components, styled components, hooks as useEffect and useState. 
Also i will make a JSON server from which i would fetch my data.
