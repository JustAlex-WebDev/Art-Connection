# E-Commerce-Shop-FAKE-API-Project (Latest Version)

This is the latest version of the e-commerce-shop app. All the code from the previous two versions of the project (simple and advanced) will be refactored and recoded in a more modern and cleaner way. The new version of the website will be styled with Tailwind CSS. Also, there will be a lot of cool features such as using Context for the Light/Dark Theme, using Routes from React-Router-Dom to navigate to different pages and Firebase backend, with which I am going to be able to authenticate new users, sign up new users then sign in with that user and store user specific data and finally sign out. It would be good for people to be able to keep track of an item they like or to simply buy one. Therefor, there will be favourites and shopping cart which people would be able to use after  being authenticated.
