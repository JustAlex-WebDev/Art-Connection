# E-Commerce-Shop-FAKE-API-Project

## About the app

The final version of the website (latest-version) will be styled with Tailwind CSS and there would be a lot of cool features such as using Context for the Light/Dark Theme, the Authentication and the Checkout. Also Routes from React-Router-Dom will be implemented in order to navigate throughout different pages and Firebase backend, with which I am going to be able to authenticate new users, sign up new users then sign in with that user and store user specific data and finally sign out. It would be good for people to be able to keep track of an item they like or to simply buy one. Therefore, there will not only be favourites and shopping cart components, but a checkout multi-step form as well, all of which people would be able to use after being authenticated.

This will be the latest and final version of the e-commerce-shop app. All the code from the previous two versions of the project (simple and advanced) will be efactored and recoded in a more modern and cleaner way. Not only this, but the whole project would be fully finished.
